hyprsqrl design principles

## Core Principles
- Clean minimalism with purposeful white space
- Content-focused interface with restrained visual elements
- Professional yet approachable aesthetic
- Subtle sophistication through refined details

## Typography System
- Primary font: Sans-serif with balanced character weight
- Heading hierarchy: Bold, distinct sizing with tight line spacing
- Body text: Medium weight with comfortable line height
- Text colors: Near-black (#111827) for headings, medium gray for secondary text

## Color Palette
- Primary background: Clean white (#FFFFFF)
- Secondary background: Very light gray (#F9FAFB)
- Accent: Subtle mint green (#10B981) for positive indicators
- UI elements: Light gray pill shapes and icon backgrounds
- Subtle background gradients: Almost imperceptible yellow-to-blue transitions
- Borders: Extremely light gray (#E5E7EB) for container definition

## Component Design
- Cards: Clean white backgrounds with minimal shadows
- Buttons: Black primary CTAs with white text; light gray secondary buttons
- Icons: Simple monochromatic designs in light gray circular backgrounds
- Navigation: Understated horizontal menus with minimal visual weight
- Metrics displays: Clean numerical presentation with small green indicators

## Layout Structure
- Generous whitespace between sections and components
- Strong grid alignment for dashboard elements
- Balanced content density that prioritizes readability
- Strategic use of subtle background patterns for depth

## Interactive Elements
- Clear visual hierarchy for primary vs. secondary actions
- "How it works" secondary buttons with video icons
- Subtle hover states and transitions
- Educational UI elements connected to relevant content with directional cues

## Visual Finesse
- Nearly invisible background gradients for subtle dimension
- Extremely light line graphics for section delineation
- Restrained use of shadows and elevation
- Intentional simplicity that feels premium rather than plain

## Implementation Notes
- Use Tailwind's spacing system consistently (prefer multiples of 4)
- Maintain consistent border-radius values across components
- For shadows, use subtle values with low opacity
- Use the accent color sparingly to highlight important actions or information
- Follow the typography scale defined in the Tailwind config
