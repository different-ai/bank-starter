# Mock Data for Landing Hero (packages/web/src/app/(landing)/page.tsx)

- The following elements are currently mocked and should be replaced with real data/assets:
  1. **Squirrel SVG illustration with geometric scatter:** Placeholder SVG and background shapes used for the hero illustration (replace with final brand asset and animation if desired)
  2. **Feature icons row:** Lucide icons and captions for "multi-currency", "auto yield", "instant invoicing", "secure transfers" (replace with final iconography and copy as needed)
  3. **Partner logos:** Placeholder SVGs for Stripe, Wise, Deel (replace with official logo assets and update partners as needed)

**Remember to update these before launch for production polish.**
